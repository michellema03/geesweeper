geesweeper was a solo project created for Hack The North 2021.
The inspiration came from the classic game Minesweeper and the abundance of geese on UW campus.

A bug/feature is that, once a blank tile is clicked, only the tiles directly adjacent are revealed as well
  rather than all the adjacent-touching tiles.
